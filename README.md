This is a roguelike dungeon crawler game written in [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [React-Konva](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-konva). Enemies move and track the player upon getting close enough. Health and weapon items are placed throughout the map. The map consists of multiple levels.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app can be found on Heroku [here](https://sheltered-ravine-27805.herokuapp.com/).
